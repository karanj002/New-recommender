A project, where I developed a news recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. I built a Python pipeline utilizing Scrapy for web scraping and libraries. To personalize recommendations, I explored the BERT model (implemented with PyTorch or TensorFlow) based on user preferences.
